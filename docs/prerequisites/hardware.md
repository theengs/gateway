# Hardware

One strength of TheengsGateway is its multi hardware support, you can [install](../install/install) it on various hardware as long as they have a BLE module:
* Windows PC
* Apple Mac (not tested yet)
* Raspberry Pi Zero
* Raspberry Pi 4
* NUC (not tested yet)

If you want to use Theengs into a cheaper and more portable board you can use [OpenMQTTGateway](https://docs.openmqttgateway.com/) with an ESP32.
