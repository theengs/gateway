## Launching the gateway

### For a regular installation
```shell
python -m TheengsGateway -H "<mqtt_broker_host_ip>" -u "username" -p "password"
```

### For a Docker container
To run it with minimum required parameters required:
```shell
docker run --rm \
    --network host \
    -e MQTT_HOST=<mqtt_broker_host_ip> \
    -v /var/run/dbus:/var/run/dbus \
    --name TheengsGateway \
    theengs/gateway
```

:::tip
If you've installed your MQTT broker on the same instance as the gateway, you can use `localhost` as the `<mqtt_broker_host_ip>`.
:::

### Checking the data published by the gateway
Once the command launched you should see MQTT payloads appearing on the broker. To visualize these data you have to use an [MQTT client tool](../prerequisites/broker).

![MQTT](../img/TheengsGateway_mqtt_explorer.png)

Example payload received:
```json
{"name":"F35285","id":"F3:52:85","rssi":-82,"brand":"BlueMaestro","model":"TempoDisc","model_id":"BM_V23","tempc":24.1,"tempf":75.38,"hum":104.7,"dp":24.8,"volt":2.56,"mfr":"Blue Maestro Limited"}
```

The `mfr` key has the company name of the manufacturer as its value in two cases:

* Theengs Gateway has successfully decoded the advertisement of the device, its manufacturer data have a company ID compliant to the Bluetooth specification, and it's no beacon (iBeacon, Microsoft Advertising Beacon).
* Theengs Gateway isn't able to decode the advertisement of the device.

Note that in the latter case, there's guarantee that the manufacturer name is correct, as many devices aren't compliant to the Bluetooth specification and encode their data in the bytes where the manufacturer ID should be.

## Publish to a 2 levels topic

```shell
python -m TheengsGateway -H "192.168.1.17" -u "username" -p "password" -pt "home/TheengsGateway"
```

## Scan every 55 s

```shell
python -m TheengsGateway -H "192.168.1.17" -u "username" -p "password" -pt "home/TheengsGateway" -tb 55
```

## Configuration record
Once you have entered your credentials and parameters, Theengs Gateway saves them into a configuration file `theengsgw.conf` into your user directory and you can simply launch the gateway by using:
```shell
python -m TheengsGateway
```

## MQTTtoMQTT decoding
Theengs Gateway decodes messages with Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) data sent to the subscribe topic, and publishes the decoded result to the publish topic. This allows for offloading the decode operation from other devices, such as an ESP32, to enhance performance.

The data sent to the topic should be in JSON format and must have at least an "id" entry.

Example message:
```
{
  "id":"54:94:5E:9F:64:C4",
  "mac_type":1,
  "manufacturerdata":"4c0010060319247bbc68",
  "rssi":-74,
  "txpower":12
}
```
If possible, the gateway decodes and publishes the data.

[OpenMQTTGateway](https://docs.openmqttgateway.com/), proposes a [web upload](https://docs.openmqttgateway.com/upload/web-install.html) binary `esp32dev-ble-mqtt-undecoded` that publishes directly to 'home/<gateway name>/BTtoMQTT` making it directly compatible with Theengs Gateway MQTTtoMQTT decoding feature.

:::tip
By default Theengs Gateway listens to `home/+/BTtoMQTT/undecoded`, if you have several ESP32 gateways with OpenMQTTGateway sending out MQTT messages with undecoded data, Theengs picks up all of them and centralizes the decoded BLE sensor data in one place.
:::

## Home Assistant auto discovery
If enabled (default), decoded devices publish their configuration to Home Assistant so the latter can discover them.
- You can enable/disable this with the `-D` or `--discovery` command line argument with a value of 1 (enable) or 0 (disable).
- If you want to use Home Assistant discovery with other home automation gateways such as openHAB, set `-Dh` or `--hass_discovery` to 0 (disable).
- You can set the discovery topic with the `-Dt` or `--discovery_topic` command line argument.
- You can set the discovery name with the `-Dn` or `--discovery_name` command line argument.
- You can filter devices from discovery with the `-Df` or `--discovery_filter` argument which takes a list of device model ID to filter.

<!-- vale off -->
The `IBEACON` and random MAC devices (`APPLE`*, `MS-CDP` and `GAEN`) aren't discovered as their addresses (IDs) change over time resulting in multiple discoveries.

:::tip * INFO 
Apple Watch, iPhone and iPad are discovered if they're defined with their Identity MAC Address and IRK
:::

## Discovered device tracker timeout
:::tip  NOTE
`-to TIME_UNTIL, --tracker_timeout` needs to be at least longer than TIME_BETWEEN + SCAN_DURATION to avoid any unwanted temporary offline status messages for discovered trackers.
:::

## Passive scanning
Passive scanning (`-s passive` or `--scanning_mode passive`) only works on Windows or Linux kernel >= 5.10 and BlueZ >= 5.56 with experimental features enabled.

To enable experimental features in BlueZ on a Linux distribution that uses `systemd`, run the following command:

```shell
sudo systemctl edit bluetooth.service
```

Then add the following lines:

```
[Service]
ExecStart=
ExecStart=/usr/lib/bluetooth/bluetoothd --experimental
```

:::tip
On other Linux variants the path might be slightly different. You can usually see this by the commented out entries of `ExecStart=…` when editing `bluetooth.service` or with the `which bluetoothd` command.
:::

Save and close the file and then run the following commands:

```
sudo systemctl daemon-reload
sudo systemctl restart bluetooth.service
```

## Time synchronization
If you have specified the MAC addresses of [supported Bluetooth clocks](https://bluetooth-clocks.readthedocs.io/en/latest/devices.html) with the `--time_sync` argument, Theengs Gateway automatically synchronizes their time once a day. Therefore, make sure to correctly set your gateway's time.

Some Bluetooth clocks let you choose between 12-hour (AM/PM) and 24-hour format to show their time. Use the argument `--time_format 0` (default) for 24-hour format and `--time_format 1` for 12-hour format.

Note that the first time synchronization of each specified clock happens at a random time in the next day. This way the gateway spaces out connections to these devices in time. After this first time synchronization, Theengs Gateway synchronizes its time every 24 hours.

If a device isn't recognized as a supported clock, Theengs Gateway won't try to synchronize its time ever. But if there are other errors, such as connection errors or write errors (which could be temporary), the device is still tried every 24 hours.

If you want to know which of your devices Theengs Gateway's time synchronization feature supports, run the following command:

```
bluetooth-clocks discover
```

Theengs Gateway installs the `bluetooth-clocks` command as part of its dependencies.

## Reading encrypted advertisements
If you want to read encrypted advertisements, you need to add a bindkey for each device address with the `--bindkeys` argument. For example:

```
TheengsGateway --bindkeys 00:11:22:33:44:55:66 0dc540f3025b474b9ef1085e051b1add AA:BB:CC:DD:EE:FF 6385424e1b0341109942ad2a6bb42e58
```

Theengs Gateway then uses the bindkey `0dc540f3025b474b9ef1085e051b1add` to decrypt all advertisements from device `00:11:22:33:44:55:66` and bindkey `6385424e1b0341109942ad2a6bb42e58` for all advertisements from device `AA:BB:CC:DD:EE:FF`.

## Resolving random private addresses
If you want to resolve random private addresses into a device's identity address, you need to add an Identity Resolving Key (IRK) for each identity address with the `--identities` argument. For example:

```
TheengsGateway --identities 00:11:22:33:44:55:66 0dc540f3025b474b9ef1085e051b1add AA:BB:CC:DD:EE:FF 6385424e1b0341109942ad2a6bb42e58
```

Theengs Gateway then uses the identity resolving key `0dc540f3025b474b9ef1085e051b1add` to resolve random private addresses from device `00:11:22:33:44:55:66` and identity resolving key `6385424e1b0341109942ad2a6bb42e58` to resolve random private addresses from device `AA:BB:CC:DD:EE:FF`.

You can also specify the identity resolving key as a Base64 encoded string, such as `"MGRjNTQwZjMwMjViNDc0YjllZjEwODVlMDUxYjFhZGQ="`.

## Getting Identity Resolving Key (IRK) for Apple Watch, iPhone and iPad

To get the Bluetooth Identity Address of an Apple device go to ***Settings*** > ***General*** > ***About*** on the device and view the MAC address stated under **Bluetooth**.

On a Mac associated with your devices open the **Keychain Access** application and search the **login** or **iCloud** Keychain - depending on whether you have iCloud *Password and Keychain* syncing activated or not - for either Bluetooth or the identity address you got for your device as described previously.

When you open the Keychain entry, in the Account field it should confirm the identity address as `Public AA:BB:CC:DD:EE:FF`.

Tick the **Show Password** checkbox and enter your macOS password to then select and copy the *whole* content of the field. Paste the content into an empty TextEdit document and look for the **Remote IRK**.

![Remote IRK retrieval](../img/Theengs-IRK-extraction.png)

This remote IRK is used to launch the gateway with the public address of your device tracked.

Example:
Public address: 11:22:33:44:55:66
IRK: WERknmckjn51464saa==

```
TheengsGateway --identities 11:22:33:44:55:66 WERknmckjn51464saa==
```

As a result you can see your device information published in the connected MQTT broker under `home/TheengsGateway/BTtoMQTT/112233445566`

```
{"manufacturerdata": "2c0q1006191e7v30x6fa", "id": "11:22:33:44:55:66", "rssi": -42, "brand": "Apple", "model": "Apple iPhone/iPad", "model_id": "APPLEDEVICE", "type": "TRACK", "track": true, "unlocked": false, "distance": 0.03341741003670675}
```
<!-- vale on -->
You can now enjoy local presence tracking based on your Apple devices.
